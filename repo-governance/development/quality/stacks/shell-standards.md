  Fixes the shell baseline beyond script mechanics: a dialect the static analyser supports or a named fallback, analyser
  and formatter gates, strict-mode gaps closed, quoted and validated input, small scripts, and behaviour tests without
  coverage.
when_to_use: >-
  Use when creating, configuring, or reviewing a shell script, or when choosing its dialect, deciding whether logic has
  outgrown shell, or testing a script.

# Shell Standards

This standard is canonical for shell as a stack. It inherits [Shell Scripts](../code/shell-scripts.md), which owns the
declared interpreter, strict mode, the executable bit, comments, JSON parsing, and output inspection, and it adds only
the choices a shell stack leaves open. A shell programming skill defers to both.

It implements Fail Closed, Simplicity Over Complexity, and Automation Over Manual.

## Gates

- **Static analysis:** every script is analysed at the threshold [Lint Strictness](../checks/lint-strictness.md) sets,
  each directive that disables a check carrying its reason. Example: ShellCheck.
- **Format:** one formatter in diff mode over committed settings, failing on any change. Example: `shfmt -d`.
- **Unsupported dialect:** a script in a dialect the analyser cannot read passes the shell's own syntax check instead,
  and review carries what analysis would have caught. Example: ShellCheck reads sh, Bash, dash, and ksh but not Zsh
  ([SC1071](https://www.shellcheck.net/wiki/SC1071)), so a Zsh script runs `zsh -n`.

A repository script uses an analysable dialect unless the script exists to configure a shell that is not one.

## Strict Mode Has Gaps

Exit-on-error does not apply inside a condition, on the left of `&&` or `||`, or in a command substitution unless the
shell is told to inherit it, and `local x="$(cmd)"` reports the status of `local`, not of `cmd`
([BashFAQ 105](https://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/105)). So:

- a function whose failure matters is not called only as a condition;
- a declaration and an assignment from a command substitution are separate statements; and
- a Bash script that relies on substitutions failing sets `shopt -s inherit_errexit`.

A Zsh script's strict mode is `ERR_EXIT`, `PIPE_FAIL`, and `NO_UNSET`
([options](https://zsh.sourceforge.io/Doc/Release/Options.html)).

## Type and Boundary Safety

Shell has no types, so [Type and Boundary Safety](../code/type-and-boundary-safety.md) maps to discipline at input:

- Every expansion is quoted, as `"${var}"`, and a list is an array, never a space-separated string.
- Arguments are checked for count and shape before any is used, and an operand taken from input follows `--`.
- `eval` and unquoted command construction are never used.
- In Bash, tests use `[[ ]]` and substitutions use `$( )`.

## Keep Scripts Small

Shell orchestrates commands; it is not where domain logic lives. A script that needs data structures beyond arrays,
arithmetic beyond counters, or grows past roughly a hundred lines moves its logic to a language with types and a unit
layer ([Shell Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/shellguide.html)). Within a script:

- variables inside functions are `local`; and
- a script longer than a few commands defines functions and ends in `main "$@"`.

## Tests

A shell test runs the script as its callers do and asserts on exit status, output, and effects. Each test works in
isolation per Git Fixture Isolation and Test Data Isolation, and is classified by the boundary it touches under
[Behaviour-Driven Development](../../behaviour-driven-development.md). Example: bats-core.

Shell coverage is never a gate. The available instruments report unreliably for shell
([kcov](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SimonKagstrom/kcov/master/doc/kcov.1)), so no floor or surrogate figure is
recorded, per [Meaningful Coverage](../testing/meaningful-coverage.md). Behaviour tests over every documented exit path
carry the evidence instead.

## Documentation

A script's header comment says what it is for, as Shell Scripts requires. Its exit statuses and streams follow
[Command-Line Interface](../../../conventions/command-line-interface.md) at the tier the adopter records for it, and a
script at the full bar documents its usage through help.

## Adopter Decisions

| Decision  | Option                           | Gains                                    | Costs                                    |
| --------- | -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| test tool | a shell test framework           | tests read as the shell they exercise    | a dependency to pin                      |
|           | the repository's main test stack | one runner and one report for every test | each test spawns the script as a process |

Record the choice in the repository adapter [Stack Packs](../../../conventions/structure/stack-packs.md) defines.

## Enforcement

The analyser, the formatter, and the syntax check enforce the gates in the adopter's own hooks and pipeline. Review
applies quoting, input checks, the strict-mode gaps, and script size.
