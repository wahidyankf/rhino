# PR Review Checker Procedure

Moved verbatim from [pr-review-checker](../../../.agents/agents/pr-review-checker.md), which links each section here,
per Document Word Budget.

## Procedure

1. **Synthesize.** Apply the four functions in order, as Synthesizing Review Findings teaches, under Boundary Rulings,
   Finding Requirements, and Cost and Noise Controls. A placement it makes across the highest-risk boundary is final for
   the pass.
2. **Hold what the evidence does not carry.** A `CRITICAL` finding without a reproduction is held at a lower severity,
   and a finding in high-risk scope waits for adversarial verification, as Finding Requirements sets. A finding whose
   verification needs a fact from the public web goes back to the caller as a research need and does not post meanwhile.
3. **Carry delegated checks unchanged.** Predicates the brief marks delegated keep their evidence and are never re-run;
   pending evidence is neither a finding nor a reason to wait.
4. **Rate criticality** for each surviving finding per Criticality Levels, as
   [Assessing Criticality and Confidence](../../../.agents/skills/assessing-criticality-confidence/SKILL.md) explains.
   Confidence for a repair is rated later by [PR Review Fixer](../../../.agents/agents/pr-review-fixer.md), as the
   gate's writer.
5. **Confirm the head, then publish once.** When the live head differs from the pin, publish nothing and end the pass
   stale. Otherwise publish exactly one line-anchored, non-approving review carrying the record PR Review requires, then
   read it back. A clean result is still published.
