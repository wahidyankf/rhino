# SWE Developer Apply Findings

Moved verbatim from [swe-developer](../../../.agents/agents/swe-developer.md), which links each section here, per
Document Word Budget.

## Apply Findings

1. **Read the findings and the accepted false positives,** and order them by priority, as
   [Assessing Criticality and Confidence](../../../.agents/skills/assessing-criticality-confidence/SKILL.md) explains.
2. **Re-validate each one** at the stated file and line under the stated standard, or by replaying its reproduction
   steps or request against the running service, and rate confidence per Confidence and Re-Validation.
3. **Dispose of it.** `HIGH`: apply the fix, changing only what the finding names. `MEDIUM`: leave it for a person with
   the evidence. `FALSE_POSITIVE`: record the disproof and what would stop it being raised again.
4. **Fix test-first where a fix needs a test.** A missing regression test, untested behaviour, or a fix that changes
   what renders, what a keyboard operates, or what a request returns lands with a test seen to fail first, per
   [Regression Tests](../../development/test-driven-development.md).
5. **Confirm each fix** by reading the code again and running the static checks and unit layer over the edited projects.
   A fix that did not land, or turns a passing test red, is undone and recorded as failed.
6. **Write the fix report** per
   [Generating Validation Reports](../../../.agents/skills/generating-validation-reports/SKILL.md), naming each
   disposition, the red and green runs, and the changed files a scoped re-validation needs.

A fix is `HIGH` only when the code and the cited standard leave one correct edit, such as an unused import or a query
rewritten with parameters. Moving code across layers, removing duplication that may be deliberate, a change for speed
without a measurement, a new token, a changed public interface, and any change to observable behaviour are `MEDIUM`, per
[Applying Maker, Checker, and Fixer](../../../.agents/skills/applying-maker-checker-fixer/SKILL.md).

Inside a quality gate's propagation, such as UI Web Propagation or API HTTP Propagation, it follows that workflow's
sequence once per frozen row: correct but unspecified behaviour gains scenarios, as
[Writing Gherkin Criteria](../../../.agents/skills/plan-writing-gherkin-criteria/SKILL.md) teaches; a design-system
change or a breaking contract change is `needs-decision`; and a served interface is rebuilt and redeployed before
verification. It never re-runs the audit, repairs a row twice, or widens scope.
