# No Destructive Git Operations

Git keeps no undo for uncommitted work, and a rewrite of pushed history reaches every clone that holds it. Assume
someone else is using the same machine and remote at the same moment.

Adapted from the catalog rule of the same name. What changed: an unused task branch is deleted with `-D` where
[dev artifact clean-up](../workflows/maintenance/dev-artifact-clean-up.md#when--d-refuses) establishes that it landed or
went stale, after preserving a stale tip, and that workflow's own refusals stand beside this rule.

## The Rule Is the Effect

Any Git invocation whose effect is to discard uncommitted changes, destroy work this actor did not create, rewrite
history others may hold, or remove the means of recovering any of those needs explicit approval for that one instance.
The spelling is irrelevant: an alias, a script, or an unlisted flag with the same effect is covered. Ask what the
command destroys and who made it, not whether it appears below.

## Common Cases

- `git push --force`, or `--force-with-lease` without an expected value
  - Destroys: remote commits absent locally
  - Use instead: `--force-with-lease=<branch>:<expected-sha> --force-if-includes`
- **rebasing or amending commits already pushed**
  - Destroys: history others built on
  - Use instead: a new commit; for the sync rebase, the lease form above
- `git reset --hard`, `git checkout -f`, `git switch --discard-changes`
  - Destroys: uncommitted changes
  - Use instead: commit first, or `git stash push -- <path>` and keep the entry
- `git checkout -- <path>` or `git restore <path>` over edits
  - Destroys: the unstaged edits at those paths
  - Use instead: commit or stash first
- `git clean -fd` or `git clean -fdx`
  - Destroys: untracked and ignored files, local secrets too
  - Use instead: `git clean -n` to preview, then delete named paths
- `git stash drop`, `git stash clear`
  - Destroys: stash entries, which then become prunable
  - Use instead: leave the entries
- `git branch -D`, `git update-ref -d`
  - Destroys: a branch, skipping the merged check
  - Use instead: `git branch -d`; the one exception is an unused task branch under the landed or stale proof of
    [dev artifact clean-up](../workflows/maintenance/dev-artifact-clean-up.md#when--d-refuses), and any other `-D` still
    needs approval
- **expiring the reflog and pruning at once**
  - Destroys: the recovery path itself
  - Use instead: let automatic maintenance run
- `git worktree remove --force`, deleting a worktree folder
  - Destroys: a working tree and everything uncommitted in it
  - Use instead: plain `git worktree remove`

The lease form is still a force push and still needs approval; it only refuses to overwrite commits nobody has seen.

## Asking for Approval

First look for a route that destroys nothing: a new commit, a revert, a removal without force. When none exists:

1. State the exact command as it will run.
2. State what it affects: the ref, the commits left unreachable where they can be determined, and the paths.
3. Ask a yes-or-no question and wait for the answer.
4. Run exactly what was approved. If a flag, ref, or target changes, ask again.

Approval never carries forward. The repository can change between two operations, and the earlier answer was about a
state that no longer exists.

## Worktrees Share State

Task worktrees under `worktrees/` share the object database and every ref with the primary checkout, so pruning and
forced removal reach state other worktrees depend on. Never pass `--ignore-other-worktrees`. A destructive operation in
a worktree this task does not use needs positive evidence that the worktree is idle.

## Prefer Additive

When a destructive and an additive operation reach the same end state, take the one that leaves a trail. Before any bulk
deletion, run its dry-run form.

## Enforcement

No gate checks this. A hook cannot tell an approved force push from an unapproved one, so the rule depends on attention.
The `main` ruleset refuses direct pushes, force pushes, and deletion of `main` for every actor.
