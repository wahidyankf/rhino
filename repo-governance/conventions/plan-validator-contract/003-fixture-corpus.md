# The Shared Fixture Corpus

The corpus lives at `specs/fixtures/plan-structure/`. Every implementation of this contract runs against it, and
agreement between implementations means agreement on these exact bytes.

## Contents

```text
accepted/<NNN>-<slug>/plans/...   a tree that must produce exit 0
rejected/<NNN>-<slug>/plans/...   a tree that must produce exit 1
manifest.tsv                      case, expected exit, expected rule identifiers, note
SHA256SUMS                        per-file digests over every corpus file
```

`manifest.tsv` is the contract's test table. A run is correct when, for every case, the exit class matches and the set
of emitted rule identifiers equals the declared set — not merely contains it.

## One Rule Per Rejected Case

Each rejected case trips exactly one rule.

A fixture that violates three rules at once cannot tell an implementation that found all three from one that stopped at
the first, and a suite built from such fixtures reports agreement that was never tested.

## Everything Is Synthetic

No path, name, slug, or body comes from a real repository. Cases are invented to exercise a rule and describe no actual
work.

This is a safety property, not a stylistic one. The corpus is public and is copied into other repositories, so a fixture
derived from real content would carry whatever that content contained.

## The Bytes Are the Fixture

The corpus is excluded from this repository's formatter and Markdown linter, and that exclusion is deliberate. A
reformat is not cosmetic here: it changes what the suite tests, and its first visible effect is a result nobody can
attribute.

## No Obligation Upstream

This copy is owned here. No digest pins it to the catalog, there is no pin check and no drift ledger, and nothing
requires this repository to notice that `ose-rules` changed. That is the catalog's own adoption model, and adopting a
corpus does not create a subscription to it.

Parity is restored by a named re-adoption task, not by a check. Between such tasks the copies may legitimately diverge.

## Changing the Corpus

Adding a case is routine. Editing one is not, unless the rule it encodes changed.

Any change regenerates `SHA256SUMS` in the same change, so the local integrity check keeps describing what is there.

## Verifying

```bash
shasum -a 256 -c SHA256SUMS
```

Run from the corpus root. A mismatch is a stop, not a warning: whatever the validator then reports was measured against
something other than the corpus under test.
