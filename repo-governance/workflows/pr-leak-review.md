# PR Leak Review

One narrow review, posted on the pull request, for the exact head that will merge. It is a
[merge precondition](../conventions/pull-request-merge.md): no leak review, no merge.

Adapted from the sibling repository that originated it. What changed here: there is no separate
reviewer agent, the review is performed by whoever handles the merge, and the categories are the
ones [data safety](../conventions/public-repository-data-safety.md) already names for this
repository. The evidence marker keeps the sibling's name so one reader can authenticate a record
from any of these repositories.

## What It Inspects

Exactly three categories, and nothing else:

1. Real secrets, credentials, or other values that grant access.
2. Properties that belong in environment or secret storage rather than a tracked file.
3. Real machine-specific absolute paths, and real host evidence captured from a workstation.

This is not a security review and not a semantic one. A public identifier, a documented public
value, an obvious placeholder, a repository-relative path, and a deliberately synthetic fixture are
not leaks. A name containing `key`, `token`, `secret`, or `prod` is not evidence by itself; treat a
candidate as a finding only where its shape and its context establish that the value is real.

## Procedure

1. Pin the head SHA. Everything below is about that SHA and no other.
2. Read the whole diff at it — not the summary, not memory of what was written.
3. Post one review on the pull request carrying the record below. Post it whatever the result is:
   a pass that was never written down is indistinguishable from a review nobody ran.
4. Read the review back through the API and confirm its `commit_id` equals the pinned SHA.
5. Query the live head again.

```html
<!-- ose-pr-leak-review:v1
{"repository":"owner/repo","pull_request":0,"base_ref":"main",
 "base_sha":"<base SHA>","head_sha":"<reviewed SHA>","result":"pass|findings",
 "counts":{"secret_or_private_value":0,"protected_environment_property":0,
 "machine_specific_absolute_path":0}}
-->
```

## Results

`pass` when every count is zero, `findings` when any is not, `stale` when the head moved before or
after posting, and `failed` when no verdict could be obtained. Only `pass`, on the exact head being
merged, satisfies the precondition.

A moved head needs one new review of the new head. Clean reviews do not accumulate: three passes on
three old heads say nothing about the head that will merge.

## Findings

Name the category, the file, and the remediation. Never repeat the value, and never paste it into a
review body, a commit message, or a pull-request body — those are published too. Treat anything
found as already disclosed: rotate first, then remove.

The review body is itself a published artifact. A local absolute path pasted into it is the same
finding the review exists to catch.
