# Leak Classes

A leak review judges three classes and no others. Each maps to the record's count of the same name, and each is a part
of what [data safety](../../conventions/public-repository-data-safety.md) already prohibits here.

| Class                            | A finding is                                                            |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `secret_or_private_value`        | a real credential or other value that grants access, in any environment |
| `protected_environment_property` | a value that belongs in environment or secret storage                   |
| `machine_specific_absolute_path` | a home path, username, hostname, or private address naming its machine  |

A protected property is, for example, a connection string or a non-public environment's endpoint or account identifier.
An absolute home path is `/Users/<name>/`, `/home/<name>/`, or `C:\Users\<name>\`. Staging and production credentials
are named because they reach real data and real users, not because other environments are exempt.

## Real Means Real

Any real credential is a finding, whichever environment it belongs to: a development key that works is still a key, and
deciding which environment a token reaches is guesswork the review does not attempt. Only a value that is unmistakably
synthetic passes.

## What Is Not a Leak

- A home-relative path such as `~/notes`. It names no account and resolves on every machine.
- A repository-relative path, or a documented placeholder such as `<username>` or `<repo-root>`.
- Public identifiers, documented public values, and loopback addresses in test configuration that targets a local
  service.
- Synthetic fixtures that are unmistakably synthetic.

A name containing `key`, `token`, `secret`, or `prod` is not evidence alone. A candidate is a finding only when shape
and context show the value is real. Data safety still prefers a repository-relative path or a placeholder; that a `~/`
path is not a leak does not make it the preferred form.

## History Is the Subject

Every commit bound for the remote is outbound on its own. A value added by one commit and deleted by the next is
published with both, and every clone keeps it. A review therefore reads each commit's additions, its file names, and its
message, never only the range's final files.

The review binds from adoption onward. Content a range does not add is not judged again, and history published before
adoption is out of scope for the review; a leak found there is handled under
[data safety](../../conventions/public-repository-data-safety.md#if-it-already-landed) instead.

## The Review Is Itself Published

The review body is outbound like every other artifact on a public repository. A path pasted into it is the finding the
review exists to catch, and a quoted secret is published again in the record of its discovery. Anything found is treated
as already disclosed.

It is not a security or semantic review. A screen matches shapes; this review reads context, and three classes keep it
small enough for every push and every head.
