# Git Clean-Up

Removing exactly the Git artifacts one piece of work created, and bringing the primary checkout's `main` back level with `origin/main`. The obligations are stated in [integration path](../conventions/integration-path.md); this is the order, and the checks that make deleting safe.

## Scope

Four things, and nothing else: the worktree this work provisioned, its local branch, that branch on `origin`, and the primary checkout's `main` ref.

Everything else on the machine belongs to someone else — a worktree this work did not create, a branch it did not open, another repository's state. That holds even when they look abandoned.

## When

Once every delivery unit that used the worktree has landed, or once the work is deliberately abandoned. Not between units, because the worktree is reused. Never as a periodic sweep.

Retain the worktree of a run that failed, and say so, rather than deleting the evidence.

## Before Deleting Anything

1. Nothing is unpushed: `git status --porcelain` is empty and `git log <branch> --not --remotes` prints nothing.
2. Nothing is running in the worktree.
3. The worktree is one this work provisioned — check it against `git worktree list`.
4. The pull request reports merged, or the abandonment is deliberate.

## Procedure

Run from the primary checkout, never from inside the directory being removed: a shell holding a deleted working directory resolves the next relative path somewhere unintended.

```sh
git fetch origin --prune
git merge --ff-only origin/main
git rev-list --left-right --count HEAD...origin/main
git worktree remove worktrees/<name>
git branch -d worktree/<name>
git push origin --delete worktree/<name>
```

The count must read `0 0`. `--prune` drops the remote-tracking ref for a branch the forge deleted on merge; without it the branch keeps appearing in `git branch -a` after it is gone. Delete on `origin` only if merging did not.

Where a clone has no primary checkout, `git fetch origin main:main` reconciles without one — never against a branch checked out somewhere.

## When `-d` Refuses

`git branch -d` refuses a branch whose commits `main` does not literally contain, so after a rebase merge it always refuses: the landed commits carry different hashes than the ones on the branch, and this repository merges by rebase.

Read the refusal before answering it. Where the pull request reports merged and the change is on `origin/main`, `-D` is correct, because `-d` is asking about hashes rather than about content. Where that is not established, `-D` discards work.

## Verification

`git worktree list` no longer names the path, `git branch --list` no longer prints the branch, the branch is gone from `origin`, and the count above reads `0 0`.

## Never

Never delete an artifact another actor created. Never stash to clear a worktree before removing it — the stash stack is shared across every worktree of a clone, so a pop elsewhere takes an entry it did not create.
