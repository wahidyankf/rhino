# Rules Grooming

Run only on explicit direction. Grooming is a recurring sweep of the rule corpus for volume that carries no obligation. It is never the remedy for one file exceeding its word budget; [progressive disclosure](../principles/progressive-disclosure.md) handles that.

Grooming never writes. [Rules propagation](rules-propagation.md) is the sole writer, and finding an edit does not make grooming an exception. This workflow discovers, ranks, and hands off. It never invokes the [rules quality gate](rules-quality-gate.md), which needs its own direction.

## Admitted Classes

- **Cross-surface duplication** — one obligation stated on two or more surfaces with no recorded reason to keep both. Keep the canonical home by authority order, then the narrowest binding surface, and replace the rest with links. Every candidate carries a target-completeness check: the surviving home must already cover every case the removed text covered. A candidate failing it becomes "complete the target first", not a deletion.
- **Non-normative scaffolding** — prose stating no obligation: meta-narration, a preamble restating its own heading, a transition adding no condition. It deletes whole sentences and never rewrites one. Expect little.
- **Retirement** — a rule whose subject no longer exists, that a later rule supersedes in fact but not in text, or that no surface and no gate reaches. Absent inbound links alone are insufficient evidence. This is the only class that removes an obligation.

Nothing else is a candidate.

## Refused Permanently

- Rewriting prose to save words, or weakening any audience qualifier, scope boundary, exception, or pass condition.
- Trimming a safety guardrail: data safety, commit and push authorization, HIPPO exit-code handling, the product's read-only and network-free invariants, the coverage floor, release immutability.
- Removing or hollowing a document naming a convention, principle, development standard, or workflow without per-item authorization naming that document.
- Raising a word budget, in any class, for any reason.
- Deleting a rule to make room.

## Procedure

1. Record a pre-run obligation inventory under `local-tmp/rules-grooming/`: every distinct obligation with its audience, condition, and locations.
2. Discover candidates per admitted class, each carrying its class, affected paths, measured yield in lines, and evidence.
3. Rank by yield over risk — duplication and scaffolding low, retirement high — then group by subject. Drop any candidate whose yield is not worth one propagation transaction.
4. Present the ranked manifest for approval. Duplication and scaffolding approve as a batch, scaffolding only against verbatim enumerated sentences. Retirement approves per item with its own evidence; a batch approval of retirements is not accepted. An entry-point document needs authorization naming it, whatever class proposed it. No answer is not approval. Record every rejection and deferral with a reason, and keep deferrals in the manifest so the next run does not rediscover them as new.
5. Hand each approved subject group to propagation once, in ranked order, with its surfaces, canonical home, and evidence. Propagation's blockers bind: record one against its item and continue. Never restate an item more loosely to get it accepted, and never let a merge raise a budget.
6. Re-run the inventory and diff it against the pre-run snapshot. Index entries and routing clauses are navigation, not obligation, and are excluded from both sides. The run passes only when no obligation disappeared except approved retirements, none changed in audience, condition, qualifier, or exception, and every survivor stays reachable from a surface binding its audience.
7. Record the run, its size delta, and each item's disposition.

## Terminal Contract

The only results are `NO_OP`, `GROOMED`, `PARTIAL`, and `HALTED`. An unanswered checkpoint ends the run `PARTIAL` with nothing handed off. An unapproved obligation loss halts it: the reverting edit is itself a rule edit and goes back to propagation, and the loss is reported whether or not that revert lands. Record which class produced the loss, because a class that loses an obligation is a candidate for tightening. Passing authorizes neither commit nor push.
