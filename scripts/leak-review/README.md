# Leak Review Record Check

`record-status.sh` makes the [PR Leak Review](../../repo-governance/workflows/quality/pr-leak-review.md) merge
precondition mechanical. The hosted `leak-review` workflow runs it on every pull-request change and review event; it
publishes the `leak-review` commit status on the pull request's live head, `success` only when the designated reviewer's
latest undismissed review on that head carries a `pass` record with every count zero.
