# Creating Project Plans

The structural rules — six documents, one technical shape, ordered companions — belong to the plan convention. This is
about writing ones worth executing. A bug-fix plan is one document whose sections take these roles; the plans
convention's Bug-Fix Plan module says what makes each useful.

## Each Document Answers Its Own Question

Each of the six documents answers one question, and a document that answers another's is the commonest defect.

The rest of this section is in
[Each Document Answers Its Own Question](references/document-questions.md#each-document-answers-its-own-question); read
it in full before acting.

## Write `delivery.md` Last

It depends on everything else. Written first, it becomes a checklist for a plan that does not exist yet, and the rest of
the plan is then reverse-engineered to justify it.

## Granularity Is the Hard Part

An item should be small enough that failing it is informative. "Implement the validator" fails as a unit; the person
resuming learns nothing about where it stopped.

Two tests:

- **Independently verifiable.** Finishing it leaves something observable — a file, an output, a passing check. If not,
  it is a thought rather than an item.
- **Self-contained proof.** If proving it requires finishing the next item, the split is in the wrong place.

## Write for a Cold Executor

The reader is someone who was not present, has no memory of the discussion, and will not ask. Name paths in full, name
commands exactly, and state what the result should look like.

That reader is also, usually, you — later, having forgotten more than seems possible.

## Acceptance Criteria Must Be Falsifiable

Every criterion carries a stable identifier and states a condition that could fail. "The system is reliable" cannot
fail. "Restarting mid-write leaves no partial file" can.

Criteria that cannot fail are the ones that get marked complete without anyone checking, because there is nothing to
check.

## Check Each Claim While Writing It

Every path, command, version, test name, and outside behaviour is checked as it is typed, then cited or left out, per
Plan Anti-Hallucination. Review is too late: an invented path reads like a real one.

## A Rule Change Is Delivery Work

Compare both the intended behaviour and the file-impact tree with the repository's rules; changing what a gate,
validator, or hook accepts changes a rule. Each such change adds the
[Rules Propagation](../../../repo-governance/workflows/quality/rules-propagation.md) outcome to the delivery unit making
it, as concrete items per repository and action. One item reading "propagate the rules" can never be ticked honestly.

A delivery unit that changes what a README, documentation page, or specification describes also carries a
[Docs Propagation](../../../repo-governance/workflows/quality/docs-propagation.md) item, landing in the same commit as
the change.

## Interface Plans Widen Before They Narrow

An interface-changing plan draws genuinely different alternatives before choosing, per Plan UI Design and Interface
Alternatives. Judgement sharpens the alternatives: inventory the components and tokens already present, so they are
reused; study how comparable products handle the task, so alternatives are informed; and judge each candidate on the
smallest device class it must serve first, since a layout that only works wide cannot be the selected alternative.

## Code Items Show the Test Failing First

Items shipping executable behaviour follow the test-first grammar recorded under Phase Boundaries and Delivery Choices.
Under the split cycle, red, green, and refactor are separate items naming test path, command, and expected result,
repeated per behaviour. Under either choice the item names the test before the production path, as
[Test-Driven Development](../../../repo-governance/development/test-driven-development.md) requires.

Apply [Focused Runs and Regression Gates][focused-runs] when writing test commands and phase or PR verification items.
