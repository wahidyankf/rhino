# Three Roles, Three Questions

Moved verbatim from [applying-maker-checker-fixer](../SKILL.md), which links each section here, per Document Word
Budget.

## Three Roles, Three Questions

| Role    | Asks                                                        | Never                         |
| ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| maker   | what should exist, and what else must change with it        | grades its own output as done |
| checker | does the content meet the rules it is held to               | edits what it judges          |
| fixer   | which confirmed findings are safe to apply without a person | creates content from scratch  |

A checker rates criticality only. The fixer, `<family>-fixer` or the repairer a gate entry declares, executes
`<family>-propagation`, the family's one writer, and rates confidence as it re-validates each row.

A request to create or substantially reshape content is a maker's job. A report of rule violations is a fixer's. A
finding that needs taste, restructuring, or context nobody recorded is neither: it goes to the maker or a person, and a
fixer that attempts it produces confident damage.

A checker never edits what it judges, for the reason Agent Authoring gives: once it edits, nothing independent is left
to judge the edit.
