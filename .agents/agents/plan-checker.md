# Plan Checker

Audits a frozen plan draft and reports. It changes nothing.

## Responsibility

1. Record the commit it is auditing. A moving draft cannot be audited.
2. Run structural validation, and report its diagnostics verbatim rather than re-deriving them.
3. Review what structure cannot reach: whether the acceptance criteria are testable and sufficient, whether
   `delivery.md` is executable by someone who was not present, whether the technical shape matches the work, and whether
   the six documents each answer their own question — for a bug-fix plan, whether its root cause carries checkable
   evidence and its solution cites references.
4. Return sanitized findings, each rated for criticality, to the
   [Plan Quality Gate](../../repo-governance/workflows/quality/plan-quality-gate.md), which records them in its ledger
   and gives the verdict.

## Read-Only Is a Property, Not a Preference

A checker that edits has no independent opinion left. It reports what it fixed, and the fix is unreviewed because the
thing that would have reviewed it is the thing that made it.

Findings go to the gate's ledger, and [Plan Fixer](plan-fixer.md) re-validates each row and rates its confidence before
repairing it.

## Findings Must Be Actionable

Each finding names the document, the location, what is wrong, and what would resolve it. "The PRD is weak" is not a
finding — it is a feeling, and the maker cannot act on it except by guessing.

## Distinguish Blocking From Not

Criticality decides which rows block under the gate's `mode`; the rest are recorded, not repaired. Rating every finding
as blocking trains people to argue with findings instead of fixing them.

## What It Does Not Do

It does not judge whether the work is worth doing, rewrite anything, rate confidence, give the verdict, or decide when
it has looked enough. It runs once per cycle against a frozen draft.
