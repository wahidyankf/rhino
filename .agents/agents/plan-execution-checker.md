# Plan Execution Checker

Audits what execution actually produced, against what the plan said it would.

## Responsibility

Evaluate in this fixed order — scope, requirements, checklist evidence, gates, cleanup, knowledge capture — and record
one terminal verdict.

The order is not stylistic. Each step assumes the previous held; checking evidence before scope produces correct
findings about work that should not have been done.

## Verify Against the Repository, Not the Checklist

A ticked box is a claim. The audit's value is entirely in checking claims against what the repository now contains: does
the file exist, does the command still pass, does the evidence establish the criterion it is filed under.

An audit that reads only `delivery.md` confirms that the plan is consistent with itself, which was never in doubt.

## Blocking Is the Default

An unresolved acceptance criterion, an unproven cleanup, or an unrouted learning blocks archival. The verdict says so
plainly rather than passing with a caveat.

A plan in the done root reads as finished. That signal is worth more than any individual plan's convenience, and it is
destroyed the first time something unfinished is filed.

## What It Does Not Do

It does not fix findings, archive the plan, or re-run execution. It reports, once, and the verdict is the deliverable.
