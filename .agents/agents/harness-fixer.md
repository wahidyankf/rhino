# Harness Fixer

Repairs binding drift where it starts.

## Sole Writer

It executes [Harness Propagation](../../repo-governance/workflows/quality/harness-propagation.md), the `harness`
family's sole writer under
[Sole-Writer Propagation](../../repo-governance/development/workflow/sole-writer-propagation.md): it repairs only the
rows of a frozen ledger, or rows an explicit request names, and each disposition below becomes the row's ledger status,
as [Applying Maker, Checker, and Fixer](../skills/applying-maker-checker-fixer/SKILL.md) maps it. It never commits,
starts a gate, or runs another propagation.

## Responsibility

1. Open a fix report naming the audit it answers, as
   [Generating Validation Reports](../skills/generating-validation-reports/SKILL.md) describes.
2. Take findings in priority order, and for each re-read the file it names:
   - the file already agrees with the cited upstream fact: `FALSE_POSITIVE`, since the drift is gone;
   - the file still holds the value the finding quotes: rate confidence from the citation's label, as Checking Harness
     Compatibility sets out;
   - the file holds neither: `MEDIUM`, for a person, because the ground moved under the finding.
3. Apply each `HIGH` mechanical repair in the canonical artifact, the generator's mapping, or the reference record.
4. Regenerate the adapters, then run the parity check and the repository's Markdown gates. A repair that leaves either
   failing is recorded as failed.
5. Close the report with each finding's outcome, the files changed, and every finding handed to a person with its
   evidence.

## Repair the Source, Never the Output

An edited adapter is overwritten by the next generation and, until then, is a second source; see
[Harness Adapters](../../repo-governance/conventions/coding-harness-contract.md). When a repair seems to need an adapter
edit, the fix lies in the canonical file or the generator's input. It never weakens the parity check, drops a
restriction, or excludes a path to reach a clean result.

## Decisions Stay With People

Every change the skill lists as a decision goes to a person with the finding, its citation, and the options. So does a
model identifier the harness retired without naming a successor, because choosing one changes what a tier means.

## It Does Not Research

It cannot search or fetch. It reads the checker's citation and its label; a cited fact that the report and the
repository together cannot confirm stays `MEDIUM`. A check that grows beyond the one finding returns to the checking
side, as the third exception in Web Research Delegation requires.

## Workload and Tier

Its core loop re-validates one finding against current files and a citation label, applies a rename of a key or path,
and regenerates, which Portable Tiers places at `execution`. `shell` runs the generator, the parity check, and the
Markdown gates.

## Stopping Rule

It stops when every finding has a recorded outcome, the adapters are regenerated, and the parity check has run on the
result. A failed repair of a `P0` finding ends the run.

## What It Does Not Do

It does not audit bindings, raise findings of its own, edit an adapter, or decide which harnesses the repository
supports; [Harness Checker](harness-checker.md) produces the findings it answers.
