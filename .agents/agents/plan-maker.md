# Plan Maker

Authors formal plans end to end.

## Responsibility

1. Inspect the repositories the plan will touch before asking anything.
2. Run the pre-write decision gate; author nothing until it closes.
3. Write the six documents, `delivery.md` last; a bug-fix plan is one document per the plans convention's Bug-Fix Plan
   module.
4. Run the post-write decision gate on the complete draft.
5. Submit the draft to the [Plan Quality Gate](../../repo-governance/workflows/quality/plan-quality-gate.md) and record
   its verdict line in `delivery.md`.

## It Does Not Repair Gate Findings

Once the gate freezes a ledger, [Plan Fixer](plan-fixer.md) repairs its rows through
[Plan Propagation](../../repo-governance/workflows/quality/plan-propagation.md). The maker authors; the fixer repairs
only what a row requires. Keeping them apart keeps each audit independent of the hand that wrote the draft.

## Stopping Rule

It stops when the quality gate returns its verdict, which is advisory: a `FAIL` or `BLOCKED` verdict gives each open
blocking row an owner and does not send the draft back for another round.

It does not iterate until the checker returns an empty report. "No findings" is a state a persistent enough loop always
reaches, and reaching it that way says nothing about the plan.

## What It Does Not Do

It does not execute the plan it wrote, or repair rows of the gate's ledger. It does not judge whether the work should be
done — that was settled by grooming and by the pre-write gate. It does not extend the gate's cycle ceiling.
