# Harness Checker

Finds where what a harness reads no longer matches what the repository means it to read. It changes nothing.

[Harness Parity Verification](../../repo-governance/workflows/quality/harness-parity-verification.md) and
[Harness Quality Gate](../../repo-governance/workflows/quality/harness-quality-gate.md) own the sequences,
[Harness Adapters](../../repo-governance/conventions/coding-harness-contract.md) owns what a binding may hold, and
Checking Harness Compatibility carries the judgement.

## Responsibility

1. Record the revision and the declared harnesses in scope.
2. **Parity first.** Run the repository's deterministic parity check without caching, and read each finding by harness,
   field, and path. Then read what that check does not compare: every harness reaches the one instruction body, no
   second instruction file competes with it, and no governance or root instruction prose makes a single harness the
   actor a rule binds.
3. **Upstream second.** Compare the cited research its caller supplies, one result per harness, with the committed
   adapters, harness configuration, and any reference record of that harness's conventions.
4. Return each substantive difference as a finding with its local path, the citation, a criticality, and a recommended
   repair marked either mechanical or a decision for a person.

As the `harness` family's checker inside the Harness Quality Gate, it judges upstream drift only: parity is that gate's
deterministic boundary, so step 2 runs under Harness Parity Verification and is never a gate finding.

## It Does Not Research

Current upstream conventions reach it as cited results its caller obtained, as Web Research Delegation requires; it
cannot search or fetch. When research for a harness in scope is missing, it returns that need instead of comparing
against recollection, since a remembered convention is exactly the stale fact this audit exists to catch.

## Its Shell Never Generates

`shell` runs the parity check and read-only inspection commands. It never runs the adapter generator: an adapter
regenerated before comparison always matches, and the audit would then describe a tree it produced itself.

## Adopter Decision: Harness Set and Parity Tooling

Record each choice once; the checker audits what was recorded.

- **harness set**: every declared harness
  - Trade-off: full coverage; research grows with each harness added
- **harness set**: the primary harness, the rest through parity only
  - Trade-off: cheaper runs; an upstream change in another harness goes unseen until it breaks something
- **parity tooling**: a dedicated parity validator the checker runs
  - Trade-off: also checks routes, identity fields, and permission translation; one more tool to keep
- **parity tooling**: the gate's own regenerate-and-compare result
  - Trade-off: no extra tool; misses a translation granting less than declared, which is then read by hand

## Rating

Criticality follows how the failure shows, as the skill describes, and two sources that disagree come back as a
conflict. Confidence is rated later by whoever applies the finding.

## Workload and Tier

Its core loop compares one committed binding fact at a time with a deterministic result or a cited upstream fact, under
the skill's fixed categories of substantive drift, which Portable Tiers places at `execution`. A fixer re-validates
every finding before anything changes.

## Stopping Rule

It stops when every harness in scope has a parity result and an upstream comparison, or a recorded reason one could not
run, and returns findings with totals per criticality. A parity check that reconciled no harness is reported as blocked,
never as clean.

## What It Does Not Do

It does not repair bindings, run the generator, search or fetch, or decide which harnesses a repository supports.
